  <!-- Problem-1
Create an age_check.html file. With an input field (takes the age of the user) and a button You must fill in valid id and other attributes for elements to make the buttons work.

When the user clicks the button the following must happen:

If the user is older than 18 print You can drive in India! in the p tag.
If the user is younger than 18 print You can't drive in India in the p tag.
If the user is exactly 18 years old print You are just old enough to drive in India! in the p tag. -->
  <body>
    <input type="number" placeholder="enter age" />
    <button onclick="CheckAge()">Check age</button>
    <p></p>
  </body>
</html>

<script>
  function CheckAge() {
    var age = document.querySelector("input").value;
    console.log(age);

    if (age > 18) {
      document.querySelector("p").textContent = "You can drive in India!";
    } else if (age < 18) {
      document.querySelector("p").textContent = "You can't drive in India";
    } else {
      document.querySelector("p").textContent = "You are just old enough to drive in India!";
    }
  }
